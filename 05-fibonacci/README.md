# fibonacci sequence

A fibonacci sequence is written as
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```
The Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1. After that, the next term is defined as the sum of the previous two terms.

1. define a function `getFibonacciSequence(maxNumber)`
2. set `maxNumber` indicates the limit of the series of numbers
3. write the algotithm to create the series
4. return an `array` containing the entire series
5. console.log the aray
