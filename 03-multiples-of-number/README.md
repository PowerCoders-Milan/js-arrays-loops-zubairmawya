# multiples of a number

define a function that has to return an array with all the multiples of a number until a maximum number that you pass to the function

1. define the function `const multiplesOf = (number, limit) => {}`
2. use a `for` loop to populate the multiples of that `number`
3. save those numbers in an array `const multiples = []`
4. return `multiples` and save the return in a variable `const multiplesOfNumber = multiplesOf(number)`
5. console.log the array
