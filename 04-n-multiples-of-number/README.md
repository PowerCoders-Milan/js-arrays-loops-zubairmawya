# n multiples of number

This exercise is similar but different from the previuos one.

Before I wanted to know all the multiples of a number < a certain number
example:
`2n < 10 => [2, 4, 6, 8]`

What if we want to create an array containg 10 multiples of 2 => `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]`

1. define a function that returns an array of **n** multiples of a `number`
2. inside the function declare a variable to store the array
3. use a `while` loop to stop when a certain condition is met :bulb: use `array.length` to know when to stop;
5. return the array
6. log it into the console
